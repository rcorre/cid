Cid
===

The engine backing the game
[Damage Control](https://github.com/rcorre/damage_control).

This engine is written in [D](http://dlang.org) and
uses the [Allegro](https://allegro.cc/) game library.

The D bindings of Allegro are provided by
[DAllegro](https://github.com/SiegeLord/DAllegro5).

Cid is not yet suitable as a general-purspose engine as it lacks thorough,
documentation, test coverage, and a stable API.
